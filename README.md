the principle is simple, you must indicate, with the help of reactions, the result of the calculation of the written numbers, three = 3 + six = 6; 3 + 6 = 9, you must therefore react with the 9, you are then asked to enter the number displayed at the bottom, 992, that is to say "9" followed by "992", the expected reactions are therefore 9992. And finally it must indicate the 2 largest ore visible in the background, they have their correspondence in letter here: <br/>

In our case you must therefore indicate the A and the D, more than to validate and you can continue to use the service. <br/>

My program automates the passage of this captcha in order to use a robot to use the service constantly, even at night for us.
